# Yarlagadda et al. (2022): Trade and Climate Mitigation Interactions Create Agro-Economic Opportunities with Social and Environmental Trade-offs in Latin America and the Caribbean.


## Abstract
The Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region plays a key dual role in meeting global agricultural demands and maintaining carbon sinks due to its abundant land and water resources. The future evolution of agricultural production and trade presents an important yet uncertain opportunity for the region, but could also pose economic or environmental challenges. In this study we use the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) to evaluate the impacts of two global-scale drivers: agricultural market integration and land-based climate mitigation policy. We evaluate their individual and combined impact on agricultural production and trade across LACâ€™s economies, as well as the resulting multi-sectoral impacts on producers, consumers, and integrated land-water-climate systems across water-economy regions sub-regions. Increased global market integration results in increased agricultural production and trade revenues for many LAC economies due to their comparative advantages that enable increased market share. Climate mitigation measures on CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse gases increase revenues due to increased agricultural prices from land competition. The combined outcomes from both drivers are complex, and sometimes non-linear, highlighting the importance of understanding the interactions between multiple drivers. Despite increased agricultural production and trade opportunities, there are significant trade-offs that require careful multi-sectoral planning, such as potential loss of livestock production when pursuing land-based climate mitigation strategies, increased consumer agricultural expenditures, and extreme changes in land-use or water withdrawals, resulting in deforestation or water scarcity pressures and the resulting environmental impacts. There is considerable heterogeneity in economic and environmental outcomes across regions and agricultural commodities, illustrating the value of considering outcomes at finer scales.
